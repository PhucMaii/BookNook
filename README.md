## Usage Instructions

Install it, and then…

1. In Chrome/Safari/Opera, *make sure* you reload your web mail page before trying to use Markdown Here.
2. In Chrome/Firefox/Safari/Opera, log into your Gmail, Hotmail, or Yahoo account and start a new email. In Thunderbird, start a new message.
3. Make sure you're using the rich editor.
   * In Gmail, click the "Rich formatting" link, if it's visible.
   * In Thunderbird, make sure "Compose messages in HTML format" is enabled in your "Account Settings", "Composition & Addressing" pane.
4. Compose an email in Markdown. For example:

   <pre>
   **Hello** `world`.

   ```javascript
   alert('Hello syntax highlighting.');
   ```
   </pre>

5. Right-click in the compose box and choose the "Markdown Toggle" item from the context menu. Or click the button that appears in your address bar. Or use the hotkey (<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>M</kbd> by default).
6. You should see your email rendered correctly from Markdown into rich HTML.
7. Send your awesome email to everyone you know. It will appear to them the same way it looks to you.
